Every plant should meet specific criteria to grow. There are two separate groups - required and recommended:
- Required:
    - Flowerpot;
    - Special Ingredients;
    - Special tools;
- Recommend:
     - Fertilizer;
     - Soil;
     - Light level;

Water is condition that will have different rules for each plant. 

If you meet the required conditions you can plant and start growing the plant. If you meet one additional criteria the plant will yield 60% more production , two conditions 80% and there recommended conditions - 100% more production (total of 200% production)

Further in the progress most of those conditions will be automated, so the production will be easier and more stable.
