The main system of the game is planting different magical plants in the cabin of the main character. 

To be able to plant a specific plant the player will have to meet a specific criteria : 

- [[Flowerpot]] :
	- Size;
	- Material of the pot;
- [[Soil]]: 
	- the type of the soil and some additional ingredients like fertilizer;
- [[Special Ingredients]]: 
	- some magic will require them to start growing or mature;
- [[Water]]
- [[Fertilizer]]
- [[Light level]]
- [[Special Tools and equipment]]

 *Currently I'm planning to have around 3-5 options for each criteria.*

Depending on number of the times the player grow a specific plant he/she will receive an experience and will get better at planting and farming said plant.
Additional to that he will unlock an [[encyclopedia]] full with useful tips. 

There is chance of failing the production if player don't meet the specifics of the plant. He will receive the XP, but wont get the production(or will get some of it).
