Plant harvesting is the main mechanic in the game - produce plants to harvest resources to use  [[Crafting and alchemy]]. 

Most plant will have production:
- root;
- leafs;
- seeds or fruits;
- and others; 

There will be plethora of known and unknown recipes for crafting and alchemy. 
Some will require plants some , not. 

There will be created encyclopedia with everything (plus story related parts (I hope) related to the game)

There will be 5 rarities of the plants depending on the chance of finding their seeds/roots for cultivation. 

***Note: considering adding a drop chance on the yield materials too

The tier rarity is kinda generic:
- common; - starting plants, easy to obtain, cheap by used in almost every major (even in exotic elixirs ) elixir and potion. 
- uncommon;
- rare;
- exotic;
- forbidden;
