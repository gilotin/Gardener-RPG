## Crafting and alchemy overview 

Crafting will have two tracks [[Crafting]] and [[Alchemy]].

With [[Crafting]] the hero will be able to craft small instruments, potions and different elixirs. With [[Alchemy]] the hero will be able to distill specific oils (essential oils) and create magical powders needed for advanced crafting.
